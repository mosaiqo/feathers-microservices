# Feathers Microservices

This is my humble opinionated approach to connect different microservices written in [Feathers JS](https://feathersjs.com).

###### It is heavily inspired by the following packages and therefore they deserve some mention:
- [feathers-distributed](https://github.com/kalisio/feathers-distributed)
- [feathers-http-distributed](https://github.com/dekelev/feathers-http-distributed)
- [feathers-rabbitmq-transport](https://github.com/SetaSouto/feathers-rabbitmq-transport)

For more info you can have a look at the [documentation](https://mosaiqo.github.io/feathers-microservices/)
