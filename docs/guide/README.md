# Introduction

This package is heavily inspired by the following packages, therefore they deserve some mention:

- [feathers-distributed](https://github.com/kalisio/feathers-distributed)
- [feathers-http-distributed](https://github.com/dekelev/feathers-http-distributed)
- [feathers-rabbitmq-transport](https://github.com/SetaSouto/feathers-rabbitmq-transport)


## This documentation is still WIP.

But you can have a look at the [tests folder](https://github.com/mosaiqo/feathers-microservices/tree/main/test)
if you want to start using it before the documentation is ready.

```bash

git clone git@github.com:mosaiqo/feathers-microservices.git
